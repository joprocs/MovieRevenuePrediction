# Movie Revenue Prediction

This was a project for our Data Mining course which turned out to be a little too ambitious for time we were alloted.

## Goal: 
Predict how well a movie would do based on movie metadata from The Movie DB

## Why did we stop?: 
Our deadline to complete the project was faster than we would've been able to complete it.

## Is anyone updating it? 
No. 

## Why is it private?
I seriously doubted anyone would see this, but the chances that other students do a project like this are high. We'd like to keep our work ours.
